                    Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing private training data from machine learning models. While existing defenses primarily concentrate on model-centric approaches, the impact of data on MI robustness remains largely unexplored.

                   Deep learning models for time series classification (TSC) have achieved impressive performance, but explaining their decisions remains a significant challenge. Existing post-hoc explanation methods typically operate solely in the time domain and from a single-view perspective, limiting both faithfulness and robustness. In this work, we propose MIX (Multi-view Time-Frequency Interactive EXplanation Framework), a novel framework that helps to explain deep learning models in a multi-view setting by leveraging multi-resolution, time-frequency views constructed using the Haar Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). MIX introduces an <em>interactive</em> cross-view refinement scheme, where explanation's information from one view is propagated across views to enhance overall interpretability. To align with user-preferred perspectives, we propose a greedy selection strategy that traverses the multi-view space to identify the most informative features. Additionally, we present OSIGV, a user-aligned segment-level attribution mechanism based on overlapping windows for each view, and introduce keystone-first IG, a method that refines explanations in each view using additional information from another view. Extensive experiments across multiple TSC benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that MIX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of explanation faithfulness and robustness.

                    <strong>Figure 1: Our Proposed Model Inversion (MI) Defense via Random Erasing (MIDRE).</strong> (a) “No Defense”: Training a model without MI defense. 𝓛(θ) is the standard training loss, e.g., cross-entropy. Training a model with state-of-the-art MI defenses (SOTA): (b) BiDO, (c) NLS, (d) TL-DMI, (e) MI-RAD, and (f) Our method. Studies in prior works focus on <strong>adding new loss</strong> to the training objective or on <strong>the model's parameters</strong> to defend against MI. For our proposed method (f), the training procedure and objective are the same as in (a) “No Defense.” However, the training samples presented to the model are partially masked, thus reducing the private training sample's information encoded in the model and <strong>preventing the model from observing the entire images</strong>. Therefore, <strong>MIDRE is different from other approaches and focuses on input data only to defend.</strong> We find that this can significantly degrade MI attacks, which require a substantial amount of private training data information encoded inside the model in order to reconstruct high-dimensional private images.

                    <strong>Figure 2: Feature space analysis to show that, under MIDRE, <em>f<sub>recon</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em> and <em>f<sub>priv</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em> have a discrepancy, degrading MI attack.</strong> We visualize penultimate layer activations of private images (★ <em>f<sub>priv</sub></em>), RE-private images (▼ <em>f<sub>RE</sub></em>), and MI-reconstructed images (× <em>f<sub>recon</sub></em>) generated by both (a) NoDef and (b) our MIDRE model. We also visualize the convex hull for private images, RE-private images, and MI-reconstructed images. In (a), <em>f<sub>recon</sub><sup>NoDef</sup></em> closely resembles <em>f<sub>priv</sub><sup>NoDef</sup></em>, consistent with high attack accuracy. In (b), private images and RE-private images share some similarity but they are not identical, with partial overlap between <em>f<sub>priv</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em> and <em>f<sub>RE</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em>. Importantly, <em>f<sub>recon</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em> closely resembles <em>f<sub>RE</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em> as RE-private is the training data for MIDRE. This results in <strong>a reduced overlap between <em>f<sub>recon</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em> and <em>f<sub>priv</sub><sup>MIDRE</sup></em>, explaining that MI does not accurately capture the private image features under MIDRE.</strong> More visualization can be found in Supp.
